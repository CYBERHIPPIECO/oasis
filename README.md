#Twitter Phrases

**Automated DM**

Hello! I'm a nomadic creative constantly looking for interactive beauty in #gamedev. I'm building Cyberhippie Collective #indiedev workspace - check the project in detail at: http://www.cyberhippie.co / http://www.patreon.com/cyberhippiecollective 

Have a great & peaceful day!
Tim @mothnode

**Follow up if they have a Twitch channel**
Just followed you with my Twitch channel at www.twitch.tv/cyberhippiecollective. Looking forward to seeing you in chat if you decide to join our tribe as well! Have a great day! :)

---

**Asked for explanation**
Hello there, thanks for stopping by! Basically there are three stages for this project. Stage 1: Promotion/Funding which is currently live. Stage 2: Setting up the physical space & making the community alive through events and game design workshops. Stage 3: Rent a desk for developers. The access to the workspace will be subscription-based as seen on Patreon in tiers. All this happening both online and locally.

---

**Personal preferences about games**
I like a very wide variety of games but the top are the likes of The Stanley Parable, Towerfall (which I play maniacally with my wife), Kentucky Route Zero, Gods Will Be Watching, Firewatch, Don't Starve, Thirty Flights of Loving, Mirrormoon EP, Superbrothers: Sword &  Sworcery... Sunless Sea, Fallen London and interactive fiction of all kinds.

---

**Description of the community**
Thanks for your interest! Much appreciated :) I'm aiming at making it as a both online and physical with the online being definitely more far-reaching than the IRL section. Online meetings, workshops, streams of events are definitely going to be there for everyone. Also there will be a Slack chat community for Cyberhippie where everyone will be able to join and participate to interact with one another and exchange necessary skills!

---

Initially it was actually supposed to be a solely online community but it went a bit further than that :)

---

It is so far a single person operation and at tye beginning it was supposed to be my way of gathering like-minded people as I did and still struggle with finding the right people

#**The Meaning of Cyberhippie Collective's icons:**

- **Chair** 
The spatial aspect of the project, the place to be, **a peaceful retreat** one can either find oneself alone & focused or collaborating with others.

- **Laptop**
The technological aspect of the project, it represents the **creativity-enabling equipment** available to users.

- **Leafed branch** 
The communal aspect of the project, it represents the **people who make it come alive**, the tribe, a close-knit community.

- **Pinecone** 
As it is in nature, **an incubator of seeds** or in this case ideas. A databank of genetic material ejected to create new distant colonies and introduce thoughtful diversity.

#Gamedev Events]
Game Jams 
Ludum Dare 48 hour game jam. This is a place to build a game in under 48 hours and showcase it to the world on their website, where each game gets voted on. After a week or so, they rank each game from #1 - to #999, etc. It's a friendly competition against fellow devs.http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/
Games 4 Health Game Jam - This takes place in the Netherlands ( correct me if I'm wrong) . It's a game jam that's 48hours where a bunch of students and indie devs come out to make a game for a collabarative effort.http://www.gamesforhealth.org/
GitHub Game Jam (Online) - Not really for Networking, but you can get some exposure this way and win cool prizes! https://github.com/blog/1303-git...
Global Game Jam - Another Game Jam. Meet with other devs, build games, and have fun. http://globalgamejam.org/
7DFPS - A seven day first person shooter game jam. http://7dfps.org/
Other Game Jams. Kongregate game jams, Kongregate contests, Flash portal jams, Dream Build Play by Microsoft contest, other.

Conferences - Events - Talks 
IndieCade in Los Angeles, is a place for indie developers, and indie game developer students to showoff their game in Culverson, CA. This event is a blast to go to because a lot of non-digital and experimental games are on the games floor. Also talks are done for press at IndieCade.http://www.indiecade.com/
IGF - International Games Festival -  This is the award show at the GDC usually where they show off games on the indie-floor space, and the indies finalist game space. Afterwards they do the award show afterwards showing off that years best games coupled with the video game awards show for AAA games where the pioneers of this industry speak such as Waren Spector, Cliff Blizinski, and so on. http://www.igf.com/
IGF Website Entry - If you pay the fee or are waived the fee, you can submit your game for the judges. This is a great place to get PR for your game simply by having it showcased on the IGF website, TigSource, IndieGames, DIYGames, Indie Game Mag, KillScreen, The Venus Patrol, etc.http://www.igf.com/
GDC - Game Developers Conference "San Francisco" - This is a great place to meet and network with developers of all kinds, and even to show off your game to fellow devs. If you're going to give a talk, and you manage to actually get accepted to do a talk this is another great place to show off your game, the tech behind it, and the ludology that went into making your creation, etc.... The GDC is expensive though, but if you become an alumni attendee you'll get up to 50% discounts on passes. Typically the pass cost about anywhere from $750 for the three day pass, and around $1.5k for the all access pass. I highly recommend getting the All Access pass because there are classes and workshops that you can take before all the talks. For instance, I took a writing better narrative for games workshop which was about 2 days. The workshops are about 2 days. Note though that the cost of the GDC pass doesn't include lodging or food / travel expenses. But they do give you some discounts at certain hotels with the GDC pass if you're an exhibitor or attendee.http://www.gdconf.com/
GDC - China - More for international developers in the social games space and Eastern dev space. http://www.gdcchina.com/
GDC - NEXT , co-located with the ADC in Los Angeles, This one is new, but it should just be like the GDC where you can meet and network with other devs, marketing people, and the like. http://www.gdcnext.com/
Games City - A festival in Europe that indie developers give talks at and showcase their creations. http://gamecity.org/news/gamecit...
SXSWI South by Southwest Interactive (Austin Texas) - Not really a game space, but can be a place to promote everything interactive. It's pretty hard to show off a game here, it's though a great place to network.http://sxsw.com/interactive/gami...
E3 (Los Angeles)- Indiecade Floor. Indiecade sometimes has an indie-booth floor setup for indie devs.Note, that E3 is mainly a AAA expo showcasing the newest AAA games and technology to come.http://www.indiecade.com/
MobileCon - More IT , but it's another space to tap into.http://www.mobilecon2012.com/
PAX Penny Arcade Expo ( Seattle, Boston, Melbourne ) - This is a great place to show off your games if you get into the PAX Floor.http://east.paxsite.com/
WWDC - If you're an Apple Developer this is a place to network with other devs. Awards for best designed "games" of the year, design awards, and other various awards are given at the WWDC. Along with announcements of new Apple tech. WWDC - Apple Developer
The London Smartphone & Tablets Game Summit - Another place to show off your game if you're a mobile developer. http://www.mediabistro.com/smart...
TigSource (The Indie Games Source) Meetups This isn't a grandscale event, nor is it an actual event, but occasionally TIGGERS get together and have get togethers. Sometimes there are even TIGsource meetups at the GDC, and other events. http://www.tigsource.com/
IGDA International Game Developers Association - Local Chapter Meetups http://www.igda.org/chapters
IXDA Interaction Design Association- If you give a talk on the UX behind your game you can possibly give a talk and show off your game. Slim though. http://www.ixda.org/
Copenhagen Game Collective - More on the experimental games. Like Johan Sebastians Joust from Die Gut Fabrik. http://www.copenhagengamecollect...
SGC - Swedish Game Conference - For Swedish Developers. About SGC | The Game Incubator
Build Conference - More a web developer conference, but it is also a great place to network. http://2012.buildconf.com/

There's plenty more game conferences that I've forgotten to mention, tech conferences in general, and so forth. Even conferences that are new that I don't know of. 

These are just the main one that indies have a chance at. Other conferences in general for tech is Defcon if you're a hacker or computer security analyst, there's the London Web Conference, DICE Conference in Sweden (correct me if I'm wrong), Disrupt Conference, Wordcamp, Joomla Camp, Tech Bootcamps, SIA - JSA ( for winter sports "if you are looking to make a ski game / snowboard game go here first"),  etc and plenty more. 

For serious games, the GDC is a good place, and for other related fields of games that are in the serious sector I don't know many other conferences for them. I'm sure a quick Google search will fix that. Also contacting a local College or University to give a talk to students is another way to get yourself out there if they let you.

If you're in need of exposure and PR, send a friendly email to any game website. You never know until you try. Another great place to show off your game that's in development is to do dev-blog diary videos on Youtube show casing off your tech. Join TIGsource's forums (#1 biggest indie game dev forum). Mingle on TIGsource and Reddit /r/ gamedev and you'll soon get to know some of the biggest names in the indie field. Simply, because they use these sites.

Also don't forget to check out Vlambeer's PR kit template for organizing your game and sending big blasts of emails to send out to game sites, reviewers, and so forth.

http://dopresskit.com/ 

Here's a little tidbit about TIGSource's indie community. Minecraft got its name from the help of a thread on TIGSource. TIGSource is a huge forum of indie developers that discuss technology, do saturday screenshot posts, and talk about mostly indie game development, and the game industry.

Sometimes turns into a nomadic game-jamming entity fed with oreos and piñatas.
From rough experimental indies to finely-crafted narrative experiences, games continuously teased me mad
as a medium and unleashed emotions of excitement and immersion consistently incomparable with noninteractive
media. There is a vast ocean out there.
